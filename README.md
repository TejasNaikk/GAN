# GAN
In this project, I use Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate MNIST image data.

In a GAN, one neural network, called the generator, generates new data instances, while the other, the discriminator, evaluates them for authenticity; i.e. the discriminator decides whether each instance of data it reviews belongs to the actual training dataset or not.

## Dataset Details:

MNIST data:

Training images:  60,000 
Test images:      10,000
